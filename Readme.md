GiantBomb Live Stream Timer Chrome Plugin
==================================

In order to solve the common question asked during Giant Bomb live streams: "When did this stream start?" or "How late am I?" this plugin polls the GiantBomb and JustinTV APIs and adds a line to the live stream window with the time elapsed since stream start.
